          We estimated the average numbers of years lived with and without cardiovascular 
          disease (CVD) in normal weight, overweight, and obese individuals, aged ≥30 years.

          Methods
        </p>
        <p>
          A total of 7529 participants were recruited. The multi-state Markov model was used
           to obtain hazard ratios (HRs) for three transitions (CVD free to nonfatal CVD, CVD 
           free to all-cause death, and nonfatal CVD to all-cause death) stratified by body mass 
           index (BMI) categories at baseline and adjusted for confounders including sex, age, 
           smoking, family history of premature CVD, education and physical activity. Life 
           expectancies (LEs) were also estimated for each transition stratifying by BMI categories and sex.

          Results
        </p>
        <p>
          We found 986 incident cases of nonfatal CVD and 669 overall deaths (236 CVD deaths) 
          after more than 18 years of follow-up. Overweight and obesity were associated with an 
          increased risk of nonfatal CVD (HR, 1.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21–1.66) and 
          (1.64, 1.37–1.96), respectively), compared with normal weight individuals. Overweight 
          and obesity were also associated with lower risk of mortality without CVD (0.39, 0.20–0.77) 
          and (0.35, 0.14–0.85), respectively. Among those with CVD, overweight compared with normal 
          weight was associated with a lower risk of mortality (0.72, 0.56–0.94). Total LEs for both 
          men and women with overweight and obesity were not significantly different from their 
          normal weight counterparts. Compared with normal weight individuals, men and women with 
          obesity lived 4.1 (CI: −6.3, −1.3) and 4.3 (−6.4, −2.0) fewer years free of CVD; however, 
          they lived 3.9 (2.1, 6.0) and 3.7 (2.1, 5.6) longer years with CVD than their normal weight 
          counterparts, respectively.

          Conclusions
        </p>
        <p>
          We demonstrated that although total LE was not influenced by higher BMI; individuals 
          with overweight and obesity could expect longer longevity after diagnosis of nonfatal CVD. 
          These extra years of life impose financial burden on both patients and the health care system.
