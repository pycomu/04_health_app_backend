          "Our goal is to motivate the next generation to live a healthy lifestyle. Assist young
           parents in understanding the nutritional needs of their children and provide opportunities
            for young brains to learn about their development. Know what you're putting into your 
            body. Here are some healthy dishes to spice up your diet. More insight with minimal data."

          Our children are healthy with a BMI under the threshold. We monitor their 
          weight with the Happy Kids application, which provides nutrition advice and 
          guidelines to maintain a healthy weight through its user-friendly interface. Is 
          your child overweight? Simply enter your child's height and weight; the app will 
          find out what BMI is recommended. The app helps you determine your child's calorie 
          intake using a simple formula and recommends meals that are filled with essential 
          nutrients. The app makes it easy for parents to track their children's growth. It 
          can generate charts of historical information for you to see at a glance: average 
          weight or height, changes in BMI.
